"""Reading back the saved filter of a smart playlist or smart collection.

The filter is stored on the server as a search URI. plexapi parses it into a
dict, but that translation is lossy in one direction that matters: Plex's URL
form and plexapi's filter-dict form spell the same operator differently (see
``library_get_smart_filter_options``). Reporting both the parsed dict and the
raw URI lets a caller verify what was actually saved rather than trusting the
reconstruction.
